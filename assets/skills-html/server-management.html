    <h4 style="margin: 10px 0px;">Server Management</h4>
    <p>
        My background in server management began with coursework in system administration 
        and network programming, where I worked with Windows, Linux, and macOS in virtualized 
        environments and built sockets-based client/server applications. Since then, I've 
        expanded these skills through professional experience managing AWS ECS environments 
        and maintaining test and development servers, handling deployments, troubleshooting, 
        and runtime stability.

        Outside of work, I also maintain a home server environment where I host game servers 
        and personal projects. This has given me practical, day-to-day experience with Linux 
        administration, networking, and performance tuning in a self-managed setting.
