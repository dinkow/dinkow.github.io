        During my first year of studies I was able to take a Systems Administration course.
        This course covered the three major operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
        The course covered several topics that a typical System Administrator might face 
        while performing day to day operations like installing, configuring, diagnosing, 
        securing, and troubleshooting the different operating systems.
        Each OS was run inside of a Hyper-V virtual machine.

        In my second year this was expanded on with a Network Programming course that was more
        centered around creating robust real-world sockets-based applications. As well as designing
        client/server programs that dealt with multitasking, multithreading, and network communications.
