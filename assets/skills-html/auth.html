                I first learned the principles of authentication and authorization in my Web Services coursework, 
                where I built a forum application from scratch and implemented features like sign-in, JWT-based 
                sessions, and role-based access control. Since then, I've expanded this knowledge significantly 
                in real-world projects, where auth was a core requirement in nearly every production system I 
                worked on. This included designing secure login flows, managing session lifecycles, and 
                integrating with enterprise identity providers such as Azure AD and Microsoft Graph.
