                            As part of my capstone project in the Camosun ICS program, I had the opportunity for 
                            three months to work with Ben Leather at Three Trees Technical to help develop a purpose
                            built web application. Me and one other ICS student joined Ben and dev team several 
                            months into development. We were tasking with implementing Azure authentication, Outlook 
                            calendar integration, Sharepoint file dropbox, and a reporting dashboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ben and his team were using the MEAN stack, Mongodb, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. 
                            We had to get familiar with the existing code base, and neither me nor my classmate had 
                            any prior knowledge on Angular.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This opportunity allowed me to get a good understanding of what a real work environment
                            will look like in the field as a developer.

                            During one winter break I decided that I wanted to prepare for my upcoming web dev class and 
                            get more comfortable with React. At the time I had only done an intro class that touched on
                            React.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a basic understanding of React I started to design a single page website for my 
                            father. Start to finish the website took about 24 hours over the course of two weeks.
                            I learned a lot in the process and the extra practice helped me achieve an A- in the
                            following web dev class.

                            I'll come clean, this was basically just a retail position that I worked during the summer while in school.
                            But it is kinda relevant in the tech industry! right?... Anyways.

                            Altho most of my job was facing shelves
                            and helping people figure out what iPhone they own so they can buy the right case, a lot of people used
                            the London Drugs tech department as tech support. At least a dozen people would come in every day for assistance
                            with their smartphone, tablet, laptop, you name it. Helping people who aren't tech-savvy was a great opportunity
                            to practice using non technical speech.
