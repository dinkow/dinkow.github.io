                            A friend introduced me to Magic the Gathering when I was in elementary school and I've been hooked ever since.
                            I love the complexity of the game. The strategic depth, endless possibilities, and sense of community keep 
                            the game constantly fresh and have all contributed to my love for the game.

                            January 2nd, 2023 was the day I decided to start going to the gym. Since then it has gone from something 
                            that I have to do to something that I get to do. It has become more than just part of my 
                            routine. The gym isn't only a place to exercise, it's a place full of like-minded people who are also
                            interested in pushing themselves and self improvement; a quality I hope to find in workplaces that i get
                            to be a part of.

                            My first experience with video games was Super Smash Bros. Melee at a family friends house.
                            Ever since then I've been hooked. Video games have played a huge part in my life growing up.
                            It is a way for me to connect with friend. From split screen when I was a kid to playing 
                            online today, gaming has been a constant source of joy and camaraderie throughout my life.

                            Summer of 2021 while car shopping I ended up with a 2002 Subaru Legacy B4. 
                            I was never super into cars growing up, but with the amount of upkeep this 
                            car demands I don't have much of a choice. It is definitely more of a hobby 
                            than a financial investment but it's a blast to drive.
